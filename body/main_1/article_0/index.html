<p>This content is derived from a directory call instead of a file or DB, meaning it rendered fast, can render content pulled from a mix of file types and scripting langages, like php or html. Furthermore, it allows each element to render independentaly so instead of plugins, you can use drop-in scripts.</p>
<p>This page layout was generated from a simple JSON array. That JSON array is used to generate the html beyond the body, generate element Id attributes, add the j-make class, and assemble directory paths that mirror the generated html elements. Uniqueness in directory naming is done by using a coordinated element name to folder name with an index appended to the end of the file name, begining with an underscore. For example, header_0, or section_0 and section_1 and so on.</p>
<h3>Where is this going?</h3>
<p>I will work on this as time permits and eventually build something production with it. For now I have to make money and this is a hobby project so it may take a minute or two. Thanks for checking out my little project.</p>
